# Coding-Quiz-Challenge-4
This assignment is designed to feature my improved javascript skills and touch back on my html and css skills as well. 

## Project Description
This assignment was particularly difficult because of it's multi-step complexity. The goal of this project was to develop a coding quiz that other my other peers could take and test their knowledge of the things we have learned thus far in class. The different languages I used were HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I had a lot of difficulty arranging my code, and developed new strategies on how to better organize my javascript files. I had to restart multiple times because different approaches I had would either lead me to a road block, or I would figure out a different pathway that would condense my code and make it more flexible for users as well as make it easier to debug. Unfortunately, I still had a lot struggle when it came to how to properly format and deploy my addEventListeners so that's definitely still a learning curve I have to approach. There are still a lot of problems I've been attempting to debug that is really frustrating me because it feels like the code should work and I'm still trying to figure out how to troubleshoot some of the issues I've encountered.
